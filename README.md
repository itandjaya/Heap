# Heap
MaxHeap and MinHeap implementation

Implementation of heap classes: MinHeap and MaxHeap.
The class creates a copy of input list, and heapify it.
Original input list is not modified (for read-only).

2 files:
heap_queue.py -     Implementation of MinHeap and MaxHeap objects.
main_heapqueue.py - a file/script to test the MinHeap and MaxHeap.

Input:   list ( int's, float's, char's)
2 methods to add data:
 1. Passing a list in object declaration. Or,
 2. Adding each element into the heap by using heappush( val).
